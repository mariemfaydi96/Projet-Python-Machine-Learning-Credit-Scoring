# Projet-Python-Machine-Learning-Credit-Scoring

HeadLine Description:
Credit Scoring is a Machine Learning project for classification of banking clients: Good / Bad Client with prediction.
This project was based on 3 different banks German, American and Tailand.

IBM Master Plan Approach:
During the realization of this project we followed IBM Master Plan as our Data Science methodology.
First, we started by the business understanding and analytic approach where we define the main problematic and we identify the necessary Data Science techniques.
Then we move to data collection and data preparation which is the most important step in order to prepare our data frame and then the modeling and evaluation phase. 

Data Modeling:
Using the classification and clustering algorithms so we can predict whether is a good or a bad client to have a credit from the bank.
For the classification we used several algorithms like: KNN, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier and also we used boosting algorithms: XGBOOST, ADABOOST. In order
to display the difference performance for each models we opted for the ROC Curve.
For the Clustering we used several algorithms like: KMEANS, CAH..
